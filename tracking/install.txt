----- Installation procedure:

1. Edit "settings.php" file and edit the variables there.
   You should at least put your Google Maps API key there, which may be acquired here:
   http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxsearch/signup.html

2. Upload the script to a directory on your server.
   The directory should be located somewhere inside the webroot (i.e. "public_html")

3. Upload MaxMind geolocation database to the same directory.
   You can do this manually or let the script do this for you.

3a. Manual upload: visit the MaxMind page at http://www.maxmind.com/app/geolitecity
    click on "Download the latest GeoLite City Binary Format" link, then unpack and
    upload to the script directory (replace the empty file there).

3b. Automatic upload: navigate to your script http://yoursite.com/visitors/
    follow the on-screen instructions (you might have to set permissions to provide
    write access to the GeoLiteCity.dat file, typically 0777 will work).

4. Install tracking include to you main site pages.
   You should put a small PHP code inside the pages of your site you'd like to track.
   In most PHP scripts there is a file that all the pages include, like "header.php"
   It may be reasonable to place the code there.

<?php
    include('path_to_the_script/track.php');
    track_visitor();
?>


----- General notes:

- You can track authorized users by passing the username or email to the function call,
  for example:
    track_visitor($_SESSION['email']);
  
  What you pass as the parameter depends on how your authorization implementation.
  For an AMember installation it may look like:
    track_visitor($_SESSION['_amember_user']);

- If you'd like to password protect the script, you can use Apache .htaccess rules.
  This may be done via cPanel or manually (see: http://www.javascriptkit.com/howto/htaccess3.shtml)

- The tracker file (track.php) is autonomous, i.e. it doesn't depend on any other files
  from the script installation.

- The script uses the server's temporarary directory (/tmp) to store the tracking
  information. The old files get cleaned automatcially when you visit the main page.

- When displaying the complete visit log, date/time is shown in UTC.
